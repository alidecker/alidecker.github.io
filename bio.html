    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to my website, which I coded as part of a computer science course at Tufts University.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a small-ish town, and went to a private elementary and middle school for the arts. I was especially into the visual arts: painting and drawing were my best, although I did enjoy massaging clay into cool shapes as well. Outside of school, I played the piano and took dance lessons, and then in middle school I was turned on to cross-country, basketball and lacrosse. I have always been a math person, and loved to read.</p>
    <p>In high school, my focus changed to more social ways to experience art. I joined the choir and LOVED it, stuck with sports (this time only lacrosse and ultimate frisbee) and dance, and pretty much left visual art and piano by the way side. I missed them, but I was so busy with my new interests and friends that it was hard to make time to draw, paint, and play the piano, all solitary activities.</p>
    <p>So, in college, I made it my goal to really make time for piano and visual art. So far, I would say I've succeeded. Also, I found Human Factors, which engages visual art through design while also involving empirical research (and some math!). So, I get to do much art and math in my studies. I still do choir and dance, too - just less seriously than I used to.</p>
    <p>The future, you ask? Well, I am currently a Senior, so I feel like I'm constantly talking to people (including myself) about my plans for next year, and for the next five or even ten years. I plan to work for a few years, and then go for a Master's degree once I have a better sense of what I want my career path to look like. Then, I'll go back to work. Beyond that, I don't know, but I'm sure something good and meaningful will unfold.</p>
