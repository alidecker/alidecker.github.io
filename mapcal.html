  <h1>Mapped Calendar App</h1><h2 id="subtitle">Keywords: IN PROGRESS, UI Design, Prototyping, Animation, UX Research</h2>
  <p>I am currently working on a web-and-mobile application that shows the user their calendar events in map form. This app could be useful for several types of professionals - such as sales people, moving crews, plumbers, etc. - as well as for planning road trips and other types of multi-stop travel. My goals with this project are to teach myself some animation skills and use them (hopefully) tastefully, as well as to gain yet more experience prototyping (likely in InVision) and conducting usability tests.</p>

  <div class="flex-text"><p>The logo for this app is an unpeeling orange. The orange occupies the splash screen, and is peeled in a spiral motion as the user's calendar (e.g. iCal, Google Calendar, etc.) syncronizes with this app.</p></div></div>
  <p>The below sketches show the main page of the web app. Events are linked on the map only when one directly follows the next; when there is free time, no line connects the event sites. Events are color-coded in whatever schema the user uses in their calendar app. Home ('H') and work ('W') can be saved to a user's profile, and their current postion is also shown ('Y' for "You are here"). Lastly, the orange trapezoids in the corners are bits of orange peel, to keep with the theme.</p>

  <div class="proj-block"><img class="tablet-photo" src="mapcal-photos/IMG_1985.jpg" alt="Map view with events sidebar"/></div>
  <p>Even as I write this, I think of new things to try with this project. Check in next week to see how the app evolves!</p><br>
