    <h1>My Design Process</h1>
    <div class="contents">
        <img class="icon-photo" src="process-icons/1sketch.png" alt="Sketch icon"/><div class="flex-text"><h2>1. Sketch</h2><p>I often begin a project by sketching out any ideas that immediately come to mind after first discussing with stakeholders. I do this to get those initial ideas out of my mind and onto paper, so that I can focus on the new ideas that come from subsequent research and design steps.</p></div></div>
    <div class="contents">
        <img class="icon-photo" src="process-icons/2define.png" alt="Define icon"/><div class="flex-text"><h2>2. Define</h2><p>What is the problem being addressed? Who are the target users? What is the use environment, and do other solutions exist in the market? This step involves user research (such as: literature review, observation, contextual inquiry, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, and/or task analysis), competitive analysis, and stakeholder discussion, and results in personas, a list of user needs, and any other data and analysis generated through this research.</p></div></div><br>
    <div class="contents">
        <img class="icon-photo" src="process-icons/3ideate.png" alt="Ideate icon"/><div class="flex-text"><h2>3. Ideate</h2><p>In this step, I turn out as many function-related ideas as possible - usually written individually on sticky notes - then group them in an affinity diagram. I photograph every version of this diagram that I make (I sometimes feel a given feature could be grouped in multiple places), so that I can reconsider these variations after user testing. I also sketch out possible workflows and photograph those, too. I like to run a card sort activity with representative users and get another UX specialist's thoughts, too, to get more brains working on this stage.</p><br></div></div>
    <div class="contents">
        <img class="icon-photo" src="process-icons/4designprototype.png" alt="Design &amp; Prototype icon"/><div class="flex-text"><h2>4. Design &amp; Prototype</h2><p>To design version one of the product/solution, I synthesize the initial sketches, user data, and idea maps into more sketches. I choose one aspect (e.g., one screen on an app or one angle of a physical product) and create multiple brand ideas for that screen. After discussing with stakeholders and asking a UX colleague to review the designs, I choose 1-3 concepts to flesh out in Adobe Illustrator. Concurrently, I will have generated, discussed, and reviewed 1-3 sets of wireframes (i.e. workflows) and use these in the "fleshing-out" stage above.</p><p>I have lumped prototyping into this same step because - especially with web or mobile projects, when I may be the prototyper - I often begin prototyping before the mockups are done. I prototype and design concurrently because, as I make the functions come to life, my perspective of the product changes, and this often causes me to make design tweaks. For web and mobile, I usually begin by using InVision, but if I want more functionality and/or freedom, I code it in HTML5/CSS3 + JavaScript and may ask another coder for help.</p><br></div></div>
    <div class="contents">
        <img class="icon-photo" src="process-icons/5test.png" alt="Test icon"/><div class="flex-text"><h2>5. Test</h2><p>With my paper prototype, InVision/HTML masterpiece, and/or brand concepts in hand - depending on the decided fidelity - I embark upon user testing. These sessions may be more usability focused, or emotional, or a mix of these - it all depends on what the stakeholders decided when writing the protocol and script. Methods include: A/B testing, usability testing, and diary studies.</p></div></div>
    <div class="contents">
        <img class="icon-photo" src="process-icons/6redesign.png" alt="Redesign icon"/><div class="flex-text"><h2>6. Redesign</h2><p>Now that more user data has been collected and analyzed, it is time to repeat the process in order to redesign the solution!</p></div></div><br>
