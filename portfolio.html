	<a class="portfolio-title" onclick="sonosFunc()"><h2>Sonos Design Challenge</h2></a>
	<p>In 12 days, a peer and I designed an app in which the user takes or chooses a picture, and then the app generates a playlist based on the contents of the photo. I designed the icons and app layout and did a bit of React Native coding, while he did the bulk of the coding. Together we brainstormed functionality and high-level implementation, and we both conducted user testing: A-B testing of icons and app layout, as well as workflow testing once a prototype was developed. In the end, we won the design challenge and presented our project at Sonos' Hack Week.</p>
