        <p>I designed and coded this website myself in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I built most of the pages during the Web Development course at Tufts University, and completed the Portfolio page (this page) outside of class on my own.</p>

        <a class="portfolio-title"><h2>Sonos Design Challenge (Winner)</h2></a>
    	   <p>In 12 days, a peer and I designed an app in which the user takes or chooses a picture, and then the app generates a playlist based on the contents of the photo. I designed the icons and app layout and did a bit of React Native coding, while he did the bulk of the coding. Together we brainstormed functionality and high-level implementation, and we both conducted preference testing of icons and app layout, as well as workflow testing once a prototype was developed. In the end, we won the design challenge and presented our project at Sonos' Hack Week.</p>
        </div></div>
    	<div id="show-sonos">
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="sonos-photos/bonker-sketches.jpg" alt="Bonker app initial sketches"/>
            <p>My partner and I began by sketching out our ideas and searching the Web for similar apps. We also downloaded the current version of the Sonos music app and used this to think about branding, layout, and desired functions.
            <img src="sonos-photos/sonos-icons.png" alt="Bonker app icon iterations"/>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="sonos-photos/sonos-screens.png" alt="Bonker app screen iterations"/>
            <p>I designed all the icons and layouts for this app in Adobe Illustrator. My partner and I conducted informal preference testing to choose the best version of each icon, and informal experience testing to ensure that app workflow and layout made sense to users.</p>
            <!-- <div class="side-desc"> -->
            <img src="sonos-photos/sonos-i-states.jpg" alt="Bonker final Illustrator designs"/>
            <p>These were the designs off of which my partner and I based our coding for the functional app. Toggling the "i" button reveals explainable AI: it shows why the user-input image generated this particular music playlist in this particular genre. The "share" button (to the right of the song title) shares your image to a friend (via text, email, etc.), who can then load it into this app to get the same playlist you did.</p>
            <p>In our experience testing we found that, on a smart phone, the control buttons at the bottom were too small to reliably hit with a large thumb.</p>
            <!-- </div> -->
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="sonos-photos/Bonker-final.png" alt="Bonker final screenshots"/>
            <p>This is the final version of our functional app, written in React Native and usable on Expo on both Android and iOS. We decided to place the primary control buttons at the bottom (including the photo buttons, as in last screen) since that is where the user's thumbs are when they use their phone. There is also new button here, next to the volume slider. This is the "connect to Sonos speakers" button. With Sonos, you can connect to multiple speakers at once - this is why the icon features two speakers and not just one. One thing I would add is branding in the upper left-hand corner. </p>

    	<a class="portfolio-title"><h2>JustoCat Mobile App</h2></a>
    	<p>Here I present sample screens of a robotic therapy cat mobile application (<a href="http://www.justocat.com/">JustoCat</a> II), created as part of the Software User Interface Design course at Tufts University and later refined. All mockups were made in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        </div></div>
    	<div id="show-justocat">
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="justo-cat-photos/JustoCatStickies.jpg" alt="JustoCat sticky note affinity diagram"/>
            <p>I almost always start a design project with sticky notes to make an affinity diagram. If I cannot think of a title for a given group of sticky notes, then I regroup them until they form cohesive (i.e. nameable) groups.</p>
    		<img class="app-photo" src="justo-cat-photos/welcome.png" alt="JustoCat app welcome page"/>
            <p>When the user first opens the app, the JustoCat® logo appears where the buttons are for 3 seconds, then fades away to reveal the buttons.</p>
            <p>The "Command [Cat Name]" button leads to a screen from which the user can control the cat through their phone rather than through speech recognition. This is important if the user does not want the person with dementia (the "owner") to know he/she is controlling the cat.</p>
            <img class="app-photo" src="justo-cat-photos/commanding.png" alt="JustoCat you are commanding cat popup"/>
            <p>However, if stakeholders decided that voice commands were the way to go, I would implement a pop-up window that lets the user know which cat they are commanding, and that reiterates that the cat will be commanded by voice.</p>
            <img class="app-photo" src="justo-cat-photos/choose-cat.png" alt="JustoCat choose cat screen"/>
            <p>This is the progress page for adding a new cat personality to the list.</p>
            <img class="app-photo" src="justo-cat-photos/add-cat.png" alt="JustoCat add new cat screen"/>
            <p>From the "Add Cat" page, one step in the cat personality definition process is to set the purr sound and vibration settings. This is important because people - particularly the elderly - have different combinations of sound and touch sensitivity that should be accommodated, especially in a therapy robo-animal. The other cat settings pages would have a similar look and feel to this one.</p>
            <img class="app-photo" src="justo-cat-photos/purr-effects.png" alt="JustoCat set purr settings screen"/>
            </p>This function allows for the cat to have multiple stored identities/personalities, perhaps for multiple "owners."</p>
            <img class="app-photo" src="justo-cat-photos/monitor.png" alt="JustoCat monitor the owner screen"/>
            <p>The caretaker (the user) may want to monitor the "owner." The "Activity Chart" shows things that might be indicative of the "owner's" mental level that day, such as amount of time spent petting the cat, frequently repeated phrases, etc.</p>

        <a class="portfolio-title"><h2>EHANG 184 Tablet App</h2></a>
        <p>These are sample screens for a driving application for the inside of an autonomous flying service (<a href="http://www.ehang.com/ehang184">EHANG 184</a>), created as part of the Software User Interface Design course at Tufts University and later refined. Originally, I had all sidebar functionality showing at once, but once I learned about progressive disclosure, I replaced the full sidebar with the "swipe side for more" option to declutter the main page. All mockups were made in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        </div></div>
        <div id="show-ehang">
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/ENP166_EHANGchart-10.jpg" alt="EHANG flow diagram"/>
            <p>I often like to make a flow diagram so that I can visualize where I would like my system to have a linear structure or a web structure, for example, or to ensure that the primary functions are available on the proper screens. In this case, I prioritized safety by enabling help functions on all screens.</p>
            <p>Two requirements for this project were revenue-driven: ad space must occupy 15% of the screen at all times (unless there is a good reason not to include ad space on a given screen), and the EHANG shop must be prominently available.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-01.png" alt="EHANG welcome screen"/>
            <p>Here is the welcome screen that greets the user when they enter the flying vehicle. A login is necessary to identify the user, in order to guarantee that the passenger is certified to fly (as a passive user or a pilot super-user) and to charge the proper user for their flight. In this screen, the user has requested the flying service ahead of time on the (not yet existent) EHANG 184 app or website, and so the user's name is already displayed and must log in to ensure that the proper user is using the vehicle at their reserved time.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-02.png" alt="EHANG safety briefing"/>
            <p>The user must watch and agree to the safety briefing in order to fly. There is no way to skip the briefing - this way, even a regular user must watch before each flight, and will view updated videos whenever they are pushed.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-03.png" alt="EHANG set destination"/>
            <p>For a user who did not reserve their flight or who reserved an amount of time rather than a specific flight with start and end points, they must type in their destination and waypoints. It is possible to set frequent destinations - those are the ones displayed when the user first clicks on the search bar. The user can also click the map to add a waypoint.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-13.png" alt="EHANG in flight"/>
            <p>This is the in-flight screen. The user may access additional settings and pages by clicking or swiping on the sidebars. They may also choose to land, return, or hover at any time - I chose to have these available to make the user feel in control and to make users feel more comfortable about flying in a self-driving vehicle. These buttons are on the right side of the screen because this user has indicated that they are right-handed on their profile page online.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-05.png" alt="EHANG in flight with left sidebar"/>
            <p>This screen shows the "Cabin Settings" sidebar selected during flight.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-09.png" alt="EHANG night mode"/>
            <p>This screen displays the night mode coloring for easier reading in darkness. It also shows the "Entertainment" sidebar selected with the contact button selected as well. With more time, I would explore ways to declutter this screen, perhaps by showing a separate contact page at the expense of seeing the map.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-10.png" alt="EHANG help mode"/>
            <p>When the user selects the "Help" button, an EHANG representative speaks to them over the intercom, gives typed instructions on-screen, and circles the appropriate portions of the screen to focus on. I chose not to have a video chat because I thought the video would distract the user from their situation and add to their mental workload, both of which would increase stress level and decrease performance.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGportfolio-11.png" alt="EHANG driving yourself"/>
            <p>This is the in-flight screen for a left-handed super-user (certified pilot): they can drive the vehicle themselves using the joystick, and have the option to switch to auto-pilot (what most users use) at any time. A right-handed user would have the joystick to the right of the Hover button.</p>
            <img class="tablet-photo" src="ehang-photos/EHANGfinal-08.jpg" alt="EHANG settings page night mode"/>
            <p>The user can change some settings during flight, but not all.</p>
            <p>Users can change accent color in-flight because this is where they interact with the driving app - unless some sample screens are shown on the EHANG website profile page, the user would not see what the colors look like in context save for in the actual app.</p>
            <p>Users can connect a different phone in-flight to have access to texting, calling, and music through the vehicle mic and speakers.</p>
            <p>Users can set and name new frequent destinations in-flight because it is during flight that it is most convenient for users to think about where they could see themselves traveling frequently in this flying vehicle. They also have the power to edit destinations in case they typed them incorrectly online.</p>

        <a class="portfolio-title"><h2>Train Crowding Display</h2></a>
        <p>Over the course of an entire semester, I and four other classmates designed a train crowding display system for KCUS, Inc. as part of the Human Factors Product Design course at Tufts University. The goal was to inform passengers of the crowding level of each car, so as to direct them toward emptier train cars. We began with desk and user research, then created three design concepts that in the end we refined to one concept.<p>
        </div></div>
        <div id="show-train">
            <img src="train-photos/lesscrowded.png" alt="Train crowding survey"/>
            <p>For desk research, we read about the MBTA and its services, and we read up on the design of metro stations in other cities. To gain insight on the current MBTA train-riding experience, we conducted observations during our own metro rides, interviewed novice and expert metro users, administered an online questionnaire to all types of users, and held a focus group.</p>
            <img src="train-photos/IMG_3971.jpg" alt="Train crowding brainstorming session"/>
            <p>The team convened to create a list of user needs and a list of design requirements. We then brainstormed train crowding display ideas with a variety of crafting materials, and created an initial design concept.</p>
            <img src="train-photos/walldisplay-color.png" alt="Train crowding display in full color"/>
            <img src="train-photos/walldisplay-protanopia.png" alt="Train crowding display colorblind"/>
            <img src="train-photos/upperdisplay.png" alt="Train crowding dispay above platform"/>
            <img src="train-photos/phoneapp.png" alt="Train crowding phone app screens"/>
            <p>Our idea was to use an in-station display in conjunction with a display above the platform and a phone application to communicate train car crowding levels to MBTA-riders. The in-station display uses color-coding and height of color fill to indicate the crowding level of each given car. Since our initial concept involved much color, we tested what this display would look like for people with different types of colorblindness using an online image-altering tool. We also designed for a phone application version of the display to enable riders to see train crowding levels ahead of time.</p>
            <img src="train-photos/3concepts.png" alt="Train crowding display 3 design concepts"/>
            <p>Since we received peer feedback that all the colors in our display were distracting, we developed three concepts without color-coding the crowding levels. We had these concepts reviewed by an expert UX designer and picked apart in preference testing.</p>
            <p>After conducting user testing (simulated use + preference), we completed a hierarchical task analysis, identified hazards and assessed risks, and completed a heuristic analysis. From these and our previous findings, we generated design and research ideas for future iterations of our concept. We presented all of the above infomation to KCUS, Inc. representatives.</p>

            <p>I painted this landscape in 2013. The tiny tree in the center of the painting is where my dog, Annie, is buried. There is an orb of red-orange behind her to represent a setting or a rising sun, since she has died and yet the tree is rising. Acrylic on canvas. I also chose the frame.</p>
            <img src="art-photos/IMG_3893.jpg" alt="Portrait of Cris"/>
            <p>I asked my cousin to pose, and this is the face he made. I thought this spoke more to his character than a smile or neutral face would, so I went with it. Acrylic on art paper.</p>

            <p>I decorated the cover of a box for my grandfather for Father's Day, 2014. He likes old cars. Sharpie on cardboard.</p>
            <img src="art-photos/IMAG0148_1.jpg" alt="Pressed flower bookmark"/>
            <p>I made this bookmark for my high school boyfriend (in 2014) out of dried flowers and decorative paper. I had to sort through how to flatten the flower petals without cracking them, and I opted to use clear packing tape rather than laminating paper because the former is thinner and made for a thinner bookmark. This small project taught me to be aware of my materials and their properties.</p>
            <img id="spoon-carving" src="art-photos/IMG_3461.jpg" alt="Spoon carving"/>
            <p>I went on a Study Abroad program, and since my host mother liked to cook, I carved this design into a wooden spoon. I first sized the paper around the spoon, then sketched on it, wrapped this paper around the spoon, and carved the design into the spoon using my Swiss Army knife.</p>
