  <p>This page contains art works I've completed over the past few years.<p>
  <div class="proj-block"><img class="reg-photo" src="art-photos/IMG_4201.jpg" alt="Trees painting"/>
  <div class="flex-text"><p>I painted this landscape in 2013. The tiny tree in the center of the painting is where my dog, Annie, is buried. There is an orb of red-orange behind her to represent a setting or a rising sun, since she has died and yet the tree is rising. Acrylic on canvas. I also chose the frame.</p></div></div>
  <div class="proj-block"><img class="reg-photo" src="art-photos/IMG_3893.jpg" alt="Portrait of Cris"/>
  <div class="flex-text"><p>I asked my cousin to pose, and this is the face he made. I thought this spoke more to his character than a smile or neutral face would, so I went with it. Acrylic on art paper.</p></div></div>
  <div class="proj-block"><img class="reg-photo" src="art-photos/IMAG0090.jpg" alt="Papa sharpie decorated box cover"/>
  <div class="flex-text"><p>I decorated the cover of a box for my grandfather for Father's Day, 2014. He likes old cars. Sharpie on cardboard.</p></div></div>
  <div class="proj-block"><img class="reg-photo" src="art-photos/IMAG0148_1.jpg" alt="Pressed flower bookmark"/>
  <div class="flex-text"><p>I made this bookmark for my high school boyfriend (in 2014) out of dried flowers and decorative paper. I had to sort through how to flatten the flower petals without cracking them, and I opted to use clear packing tape rather than laminating paper because the former is thinner and made for a thinner bookmark. This small project taught me to be aware of my materials and their properties.</p></div></div>
  <div class="proj-block"><img id="spoon-carving" src="art-photos/IMG_3461.jpg" alt="Spoon carving"/>
  <div class="flex-text"><p>I went on a Study Abroad program, and since my host mother liked to cook, I carved this design into a wooden spoon. I first sized the paper around the spoon, then sketched on it, wrapped this paper around the spoon, and carved the design into the spoon using my Swiss Army knife.</p></div></div>
