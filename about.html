    <div class="bio">
      <div class="bp">Hello! Welcome to my website, which I both designed and coded.</div>
      <div class="bp">I grew up in a small-ish town, and attended a private elementary and middle school for the arts. I was especially interested the visual arts: painting and drawing were my best, although I did enjoy massaging clay into cool shapes as well. Outside of school, I played the piano and took dance lessons, and later played a few sports. I have always been a math person, and love to read.</div>
      <div class="bp">In high school, my focus shifted to more social art experiences. I joined the choir and <span class=love> loved </span> it (enough to become President my Senior year), stuck with dance and a couple sports, and pretty much left visual art and piano by the way side. I missed them, but I was so busy with my new interests and friends that it was difficult to make time to draw, paint, and play the piano, all solitary activities.</div>
      <div class="bp">So, in college, I made it my goal to make time for piano and visual art while continuing to sing and involve myself in choir leadership, and I succeeded. I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics">Human Factors</a> (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_psychology">Engineering Psychology</a>), which engages visual art through design while also involving empirical research (which involves reading and math!). I still dance and run, too - just less seriously than I used to.</div>
      <div class="bp">The future, you ask? Well, I am a recent college graduate, so I am constantly talking to people (including myself) about my plans for this year, as well as for the next five or even ten years. I plan to find a position in user experience (UX) design and work there for a few years. Then, I plan to go for a Master's degree once I have a better sense of what I want my career path to look like, after which I'll go back to work. Beyond that, I don't know, but I'm sure something good and meaningful will unfold. I'm looking forward to finding out what I'll do.</div>
